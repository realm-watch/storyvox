 * The playback layer asks for "everything Auto/Wear/notification needs in
 * one row" because it can't afford a second query while answering an Auto
 * onPlayFromMediaId or building a now-playing notification on the wire.
 *
 * Each type is a flat record carrying the strings/ids the player binds to
 * directly. Anything richer (genres, full chapter HTML) belongs on the
